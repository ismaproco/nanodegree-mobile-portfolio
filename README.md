## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.

#Development

* Optimizing the index.html

- The first thing I did was to execute the PageSpeed test of google to identify the initial issues of the page.
- based on the results I started optimizing the image file size of pizzeria.jpg, I create another image wich I called pizzeria mini, with a width size of 100px, because was being set like that by default in the image style. I use a google recommended application for image optimization: http://jpegclub.org/
- Repeat the same process with the profile pic.

- Then I start to optimize the blocking css and javascript files.
- First I move the analytics code to the end of the perfmatters.js so there will only be one file with js code.
- Second I added the media=print to the print specific styles.
- Third, Added the async option to the js asset load, in this way I will not block the CPR.
- Lastly I found that I will get the best results if I move the styles and js files at the bottom of the page so the html parse will not be affected.

* Optimizing pizza.html

- The first thing I did was play with the and save every result in the Time line.
- In there I identify the processes that take more time in the page in two aspects.
- The first is when I scrolled the page, and the second when I change the pizza size.
- Working in the method: changePizzaSizes.
- While testing I found the multiple querySelectors inside the for loop were taking a lot of time to recalculate the same dx and width, for all the images even if all the images will have the same size, then I improve the algorithm calculating the values just once before the loop and then assign those values to each one of the pizzas. I reach a time of ~2-4ms.
- Working in the method: updatePositions
- I found the ScrollTop was request in each loop iteration and that was taking a lot of painting time, so I extract that value from the function and do the calc outside the loop. There was a huge performance improvement just with that, then I started looking at the Math.sin used for the phase calculation to be repeated to each 5ht element so I extracted that calculation of the method and put it an array.
